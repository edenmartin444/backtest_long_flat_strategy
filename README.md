# Goal
The goal here is to create a very simple backtest of the following strategy : 
- I work on BTC/USD. When a short SMA crosses the long SMA AND the RSI   , I take a long position, otherwise I don't take any position.

# Roadmap 
Get the OHLCV data of BTC in 2025. Calculate the indicators.
For every candle (probably 1-day), see if I take a long or flat position.
Calculate the metrics of the strategy. 
See if the strategy worked, and why.
